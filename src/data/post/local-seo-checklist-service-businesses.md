Local SEO is one of the few marketing channels where **small service businesses can outrank bigger competitors**.

But most sites don’t lose rankings because of advanced SEO.

They lose because the basics are missing:
- Google Business Profile isn’t fully set up
- pages don’t match the services you actually sell
- no location signals
- slow mobile experience
- weak trust signals

Below is a practical **25‑point Local SEO checklist** for UK service businesses (trades, clinics, consultants, agencies — anyone who serves a local area).

If you tick these off, you’ll usually see improvements in:
- Google Maps visibility
- local organic rankings
- calls and enquiry form submissions

---

## 1) Google Business Profile (GBP) — the fastest wins

### 1) Claim and verify your profile
If you haven’t verified, you’re invisible in Maps.

### 2) Use the real business name (no keyword stuffing)
Don’t add “best plumber London” etc. It can get you suspended.

### 3) Choose the right primary category
Your **primary category** has a huge impact. Pick the most accurate one.

### 4) Add 3–10 secondary categories
Only if they genuinely match what you do.

### 5) Set hours, service areas, and contact details
Make sure hours match reality, and your phone number is consistent.

### 6) Add photos that look real
Real photos beat stock every time:
- team/van/storefront
- before/after
- your workspace

### 7) Add services and products
Use the Services section to match what people search.

### 8) Post updates (1–2 per month)
It signals activity and can increase conversions.

---

## 2) Website structure — rank for what you actually sell

### 9) One page per “money service”
Don’t force one page to rank for everything.

Examples:
- /boiler-repair/
- /teeth-whitening/
- /accounting-for-sole-traders/

### 10) Make service + area obvious in 5 seconds
Your headline should say:
- what you do
- where you do it

Example format:
**“[Service] in [Town] — [Trust signal] + [CTA]”**

### 11) Add a clear conversion path on every page
Every service page needs:
- click-to-call (mobile)
- enquiry form
- “how to book” section

If the user can’t see what to do next, they leave.

---

## 3) On-page SEO (simple, high-impact)

### 12) Page titles that match intent
Bad: “Home”

Good:
- “Boiler Repair in Nottingham | [Brand]”
- “Emergency Dentist in Leeds | [Brand]”

### 13) One H1 that matches the page purpose
Avoid vague H1s like “Welcome”.

### 14) Add FAQs (and answer them properly)
FAQs help you rank and convert. Add real questions:
- pricing
- turnaround
- coverage
- what’s included

### 15) Add internal links between services
Link service pages from the homepage and from each other where relevant.

### 16) Add an “Areas we cover” section
Even for service-area businesses, listing nearby areas helps relevance.

---

## 4) Trust signals — the conversion side of SEO
More traffic is useless if visitors don’t trust you.

### 17) Put reviews above the fold (where possible)
Even a small review strip can increase enquiries.

### 18) Add proof of legitimacy
Depending on your industry:
- certifications
- insurance
- memberships
- case studies
- client logos

### 19) Add a human “About” block
People buy from people. Add a short story and a real photo.

---

## 5) Reviews — the cheapest competitive advantage

### 20) Ask for reviews consistently
Set a simple process:
- after completion
- after a successful call
- after a repeat booking

### 21) Reply to reviews
It improves trust and signals activity.

### 22) Don’t ignore negative reviews
A calm, professional reply can actually increase conversions.

---

## 6) Citations & consistency (NAP)

### 23) Keep name/address/phone consistent everywhere
If your details differ across directories, Google gets confused.

### 24) Create or clean up citations
Start with:
- Apple Maps
- Bing Places
- Yell
- Facebook
- industry directories

---

## 7) Technical checks (don’t overthink it)

### 25) Mobile speed and usability
If your site is slow or awkward on mobile, you’ll lose both rankings and enquiries.

Quick wins:
- compress images
- remove heavy sliders
- make the phone number clickable
- keep forms short
