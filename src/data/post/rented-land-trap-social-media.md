## Stop building your business empire on someone else's property.

### Key Takeaways (In Brief)

**The Risk:** Building a business solely on social media is like building a house on rented land. One algorithm update can wipe out your traffic overnight.

**The Reach Problem:** In 2026, organic reach on social platforms is at an all-time low. You often have to "pay to play" just to reach your own followers.

**The Search Gap:** AI tools and Google Search prioritise structured websites over fleeting social media posts.

**The Solution:** Use social media as a funnel, but keep your website as your fortress.

## The Day the Likes Stopped Working

We speak to sole traders every week who tell us: "I don't need a website; I get all my work from Facebook/Instagram."

It works—until it doesn't.

In 2026, we are seeing a massive shift. Social media platforms have become "pay-to-play" environments. That post that used to get 500 views? It's now getting 50, unless you boost it with cash.

If your entire digital presence lives on an app owned by a billionaire in Silicon Valley, you don't really own your business. You are just renting space.

## 1. You Don't Own Your Audience

This is the hardest pill to swallow. If Instagram bans your account tomorrow (which happens to legitimate businesses by mistake all the time), you lose everything. Your portfolio, your testimonials, and your client list—gone instantly.

**The Fix:** Your website is the one piece of the internet you actually own. No one can shut it down, and no algorithm can hide it if you have good SEO.

## 2. Social Posts Have a "Short Shelf Life"

A social media post lives for about 24 hours. After that, it is buried in the feed, never to be seen again.

A well-written article or service page on your website is different. It is an "evergreen" asset. A blog post you write today can still bring you clients in 2028 via Google Search. That is the difference between spending time and investing time.

## 3. AI Needs Structure, Not Screenshots

As we've mentioned before, 2026 is the year of AI Search. When someone asks an AI for a recommendation, the AI looks for authoritative sources.

It scans websites for structured data (schema markup). It struggles to scan text inside an Instagram caption or an image on Facebook. If you don't have a website with proper text, you are invisible to the new wave of search engines.

## 4. Credibility Costs Extra

There is a psychological difference between a business with a Facebook Page and a business with a domain name.

facebook.com/davesplumbing says "hobbyist" or "side hustle."

davesplumbing.co.uk says "established professional."

High-value clients—the ones who pay on time and don't haggle—look for that credibility.

## The "Hub and Spoke" Model

We aren't saying you should delete your social media. Far from it.

We recommend the Hub and Spoke model:

**The Spoke (Social Media):** Use it to chat, share quick updates, and grab attention.

**The Hub (Your Website):** Direct all that attention here. This is where they book, buy, and join your email list.

At UXHM, we build "Hubs" that are designed to capture the traffic you generate on social media and turn it into owned data.
