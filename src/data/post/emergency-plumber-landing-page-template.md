  description: A simple emergency plumber landing page template for UK plumbers. Clear CTA, trust signals, service area, FAQs, and a fast quote form.

Emergency plumbing enquiries are different.

People aren’t browsing. They’re stressed, usually on mobile, and they want one thing:

**A plumber who can help right now — and a button that makes it happen.**

If your website hides your number, makes them fill a long form, or doesn’t show you cover their area, they’ll bounce and call the next result.

Below is a practical **Emergency Plumber landing page template** you can copy.

---

## The goal of an emergency page
Your emergency page has three jobs:

1) **Make calling obvious** (above the fold, sticky on mobile)
2) **Build trust fast** (reviews, insurance, certifications)
3) **Confirm fit** (services + service area + response time)

Everything else is optional.

## Emergency Plumber Landing Page Template (copy/paste structure)

### 1) Above the fold (first screen)
**Headline:**
- **Emergency Plumber in [AREA] — Fast Callouts 24/7**

**Subhead:**
- Leaks, burst pipes, blocked drains, boiler breakdowns. Local response.

**Primary CTA (button):**
- **Call now: 07xxx xxxxxx** (click-to-call)

**Secondary CTA:**
- Request a call back (short form)

**Trust strip (small text/icons):**
- ⭐ 4.8/5 (120 reviews)
- ✅ Fully insured
- 🧾 Transparent pricing
- 🔥 Gas Safe (if relevant)

**Micro-proof (optional):**
- “Typical response: 30–90 minutes in [AREA]”

---

### 2) What counts as an emergency (clarify + qualify)
Add a short list so the visitor instantly feels “you do my problem”:

- Burst pipe / active leak
- No heating / no hot water
- Boiler breakdown
- Blocked toilet / drain
- Water pressure issues

Keep it tight.

---

### 3) Service area block (reduce wasted calls)
**We cover:**
- [Primary town]
- [Nearby areas]

Add one line:
- “Not sure? Call — we’ll confirm in 10 seconds.”

---

### 4) Why choose us (trust signals that matter)
People call the plumber they trust.

Include:
- Years in business / local family-run line
- Insurance statement
- Certifications (Gas Safe number if applicable)
- 2–3 short review quotes

If you only have one trust signal, make it **Google reviews**.

---

### 5) Pricing & expectations (reduce friction)
You don’t need a full price list, but you do need clarity.

Examples:
- “We’ll confirm a callout price before dispatch.”
- “No hidden fees.”
- “Photos on WhatsApp help us quote faster.”

---

### 6) Short form (only if needed)
For emergency traffic, the best conversion is usually a call.

If you include a form, keep it to **3 fields max**:
- Name
- Phone
- What’s happened?

Add a strong note:
- “If water is leaking: call — don’t wait for the form.”

---

### 7) FAQs (helps SEO + conversions)
Add 4–6 FAQs that match real searches:

- How fast can you get to [AREA]?
- Do you offer 24/7 emergency callouts?
- Are you insured?
- Do you work on boilers? (and Gas Safe)
- Do you cover [nearby area]?

---

## Quick wins that immediately increase calls
If you change nothing else, do these:

1) Put **click-to-call** in the header and make it **sticky on mobile**
2) Put your **service area** above the fold
3) Add **reviews/insurance** above the fold
4) Remove long forms (or move them below the fold)
