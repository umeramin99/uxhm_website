If you’re a plumber in Nottingham, your website only has one real job:

**Turn “I need a plumber” searches into phone calls and quote requests.**

Most plumber sites lose enquiries for boring reasons: slow mobile load, hidden phone number, confusing contact form, and no clear emergency callout path.

Below are **9 quick wins** you can implement fast.

## 1) Put click-to-call at the top (and make it sticky on mobile)
On phones, the *best* conversion button is **Call now**.

Quick win:
- Put the phone number in the header
- Add a sticky bottom “Call” button on mobile

## 2) Make your service + area obvious in 5 seconds
Visitors should instantly see:
- what you do (e.g., “Plumbing & Heating / Emergency Plumber”)
- where you cover (Nottingham + nearby areas)

Quick win:
- Add a one-line headline: **“Nottingham Plumber — Emergency Callouts & Boiler Repairs”**

## 3) Add an emergency callout section (even if it’s just a block)
A lot of plumber enquiries are urgent. If your site doesn’t make urgency easy, they bounce.

Quick win:
- Add a block near the top: “Emergency callouts available” + phone button

## 4) Reduce your quote form to the essentials
Too many fields = fewer enquiries.

Recommended minimum:
- Name
- Email or phone
- Short message

## 5) Speed matters (especially on mobile data)
If your site takes 5–8 seconds to load on mobile, you’re losing people before they see your number.

Quick win:
- Compress images
- Avoid heavy sliders
- Use modern formats (WebP)

## 6) Show trust signals above the fold
Plumbers are a trust purchase.

Quick win:
- Gas Safe number (if applicable)
- Review count + star rating (if you have it)
- “Fully insured”

## 7) Create 1 page per money service
One page trying to rank for everything often ranks for nothing.

Quick win pages:
- Boiler repair
- Boiler installation
- Bathroom installation
- Emergency plumber

## 8) Make your contact details repeat (top + bottom)
People scroll. Don’t make them hunt.

Quick win:
- Repeat phone + email + service area in the footer and on the contact section

## 9) Add a simple “Areas we cover” list
This helps users *and* local SEO.

Quick win:
- Add a short list of nearby areas (West Bridgford, Beeston, Arnold, etc.)
